# Automatic chicken coop

This project contains Arduino code to implement an automatic chicken coop with the following features : 

 - Automatic door openning in the morning and door closing in the evening (using RTC to track time and a servo motor to open/close the door)

 - LED lighting (with noepixel LED strip)

 - 4 buttons (force door open, force door close, lights on/off,
 
 - 1 potentiometer to set the light's intensity

 - 2 stops (to detect the door is opened / closed)


The www folder contains a website to deploy on a reaspberry pi that will show the image of an USB webcam and display the output of the arduino program.
